You almost feel like having a super-friendly human chat with you, right? Humans are naturally curious, always eager to understand why things are happening as they are. Ever wondered - how?</p> <p>Now, let's dive deep into this fascinating concept and see how we at Ankamala bring this to life-improvement in our local community people using our very own NLP technology and helping serve and uplift thousands of lives toward awareness and justice. NLP is no longer a buzz-word or some rocket-science for 'techies'; it's for me, you, and everyone who aspires to utilize technology in order to make a good change in society.</p> <p>That is the magic of NLP: it allows machines to understand and respond to human languages in a manner that is all but incomprehensible. It changes this complex dance of words into a bridge between us and technology, making our interactions with computers natural and intuitive, just as talking to someone who understands you would be.</p>"},{"location":"NLP-Ankamala/#understanding-nlp-accuracy-applications-and-impact","title":"Understanding NLP - Accuracy, Applications, and Impact","text":"<p>At Ankamala, the quest for insightful data that brings change\u2014especially on social issues\u2014is what drives us. Recently, we analyzed the press releases of Nepal Police and compared them with independent data sources to understand sexual violence against minors. A sneak peek is given into our findings and also how NLP or Natural Language Processing plays a very important role in this analysis.</p>"},{"location":"NLP-Ankamala/#how-much-is-nlp-analysis-accurate","title":"How Much is NLP Analysis Accurate?","text":"<p>Some of the variables that could influence NLP accuracy are the quality of data and the sophistication of the algorithm involved. Our recent analysis of press releases from the Nepal Police gave us the following data:</p> <ul> <li>Data: According to official records, in the cases of sexual violence, victims came out to be 64.22% minor girls.</li> <li>Ankamala's NLP Analysis: From our analysis, using NLP, the victims are girls of 18 years or younger, which amount to about 64.53% of the victims. The breakdown is as follows:</li> <li>Age \u2264 16: 53.46%</li> <li>Age \u2264 14: 37.89%</li> <li>Age \u2264 12: 21.11%</li> </ul> <p>This comes pretty close to official figures; this is a very good validation of how well our NLP model has been able to extract and present the critical data.</p>"},{"location":"NLP-Ankamala/#nlp-in-data-acquisition-and-analysis","title":"NLP in Data Acquisition and Analysis","text":"<p>NLP allows us to create and investigate data in the following ways without having any authoritative data at hand:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Data Extraction: NLP helps extract data from a wide range of text sources, including press releases, articles, and reports. Such data is then studied to have trends and insights derived.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trend Analysis: With analytics on text data, NLP is able to show some trends that have changed over time. For instance, our analysis provides the age distribution of victims and compares them to already existing data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Granular Information: NLP can excavate more granular information, like the place of incidents\u2014whether it is at home, school, or the relative's house\u2014and the nature of threats\u2014Fear or Coercion\u2014that helps in planning awareness campaigns and interventions accordingly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Graphical Representation: NLP analysis can be plotted on graphs and charts. We plot graphs showing the age group distribution of victims. Similarly, we can study perpetrator demography based on NLP analysis.</p> </li> <li> <p>Campaign Design: NLP insights might lead to the construction of effective awareness campaigns.

Detailed reports and analysis help in the following areas:</p> <ul> <li>Improved creation of awareness through designing appropriate campaigns based on correct data and insight</li> <li>Informed policy making through evidence-based recommendations provided to policymakers</li> <li>Better safety due to identification of high-risk areas and factors leading to incidents.</li> </ul> <p>Summary: This, in itself, makes NLP strong machinery for data processing and analytics. Proper interpretation yields valuable insights that go toward informed decisions to add value to society in general.
